    "Based on the full correlation heatmaps above, we observe severe multicollinearity among Chicago's downtown landmarks (The Loop, Navy Pier, Museum Campus, Fulton Market, and McCormick Place). Their inter-variable correlation coefficients are extremely high. Retaining all of them as continuous distance metrics would introduce significant instability and noise into any future pricing model. \n",

    "To resolve this, we must select a single spatial anchor for downtown proximity. The heatmap clearly reveals that `dist_navy_pier_miles` exhibits the strongest negative correlation with listing prices, particularly in the 'Entire home/apt' segment. Thus, we pivot from our initial baseline (`dist_loop_center_miles`) and retain Navy Pier. \n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore, we must address O'Hare Airport (`dist_ohare_airport_miles`). Although it is geographically isolated and does *not* suffer from multicollinearity with the downtown cluster, the heatmap demonstrates that its direct explanatory power regarding price is exceptionally weak. Consequently, we also discard it as a continuous predictor.\n",

    "**Trial & Error Note:** Rather than entirely losing the spatial signals of these discarded landmarks, we will repurpose their underlying data in the next step.

The gravity score (`1 / (distance + 1)`) linearizes the \"exponential\" value of prime locations, testing the hypothesis that the price premium spikes dramatically only when you are extremely close to an attraction."

    "| **is_premium_transit_hub** | Binary | Flags listings located near major transit nodes (e.g., Union Station or key 'L' junctions). Captures utility for business travelers and commuters. |\n",
    "| **shoreline_gravity** | Numeric | A non-linear \"pull\" score for Lake Michigan. Values decay exponentially as distance from the shore increases, modeling the high concentration of value at the waterfront. |\n",
    "| **dist_to_nearest_beach_miles** | Numeric | Distance to the nearest public beach access. Distinguishes purely aesthetic lake views from actual recreational utility and summer seasonal value. |\n",
    "| **crime_density_total** | Numeric | Total crime incidents per square mile at the neighborhood level. Represents the \"general reputation\" and environmental atmosphere of the area. |\n",
    "| **nb_homicides_half_mile** | Numeric | Count of homicides within a 0.5-mile radius. Serves as a high-impact safety signal; used as a primary \"price depressor\" to capture extreme risk sensitivity. |\n",
    "| **price_num** | Numeric | The target variable: Nightly listing price in USD. Cleaned and converted to numeric format for analysis. |\n",
