Methodology & Feature Engineering* Amenity Compression: We processed 2,618 unique amenity tags using a custom tokenizer and reduced them into 5 Principal Components (PCA) to capture distinct "Amenity Personas" (e.g., Luxury vs. Essentials) without the curse of dimensionality.* Clustering: Applied K-Means () on a standardized feature set including price, capacity, and amenity PCA scores.* Validation: The segmentation was validated using UMAP projection and quantitative metrics (Silhouette Score, DBI, and CHI).Cluster Profiles (The 5 Market Segments)Based on the centroid analysis, the market is divided into:1. Cluster 0: Corporate & Business – Mid-range pricing, moderate capacity, high scores in modern building amenities (elevators, dishwashers).2. Cluster 1: Premium Mid-range – Highest average review scores, typically entire homes with high-quality lifestyle amenities.3. Cluster 2: Budget Economy – Lower price points, primarily shared or small private rooms with basic essentials.4. Cluster 3: Luxury Outliers – Extremely high price points ($10k+), likely representing exclusive event spaces or high-end estates.5. Cluster 4: Group Retreats – Highest capacity (avg. 10+ guests), equipped with extensive kitchen and group-stay amenities.
